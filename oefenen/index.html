        <h1>Vampire lyrics</h1>
        <p>Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now. How's the castle build of people you pretend to care about. Just what you wanted. Look at you, cool guy, you got it.
            I see the parties and the diamond sometimes when I close my eyes. Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise, I loved you truly. Gotta laugh at the stupidity.
